# Kata Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges, also known as katas. Most of the katas come from [Codurance Katalyst](https://codurance.com/katalyst) and cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. All of the katas start with a test, either an acceptance or a unit test.

I would like to extend a special thank you to my colleagues, who have paired with me to create these solutions. Your insights have helped me to become a better programmer, and I am grateful for your support.

Feel free to use the code in this repository as a reference or starting point for your own kata solutions. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting!

## Tooling

Majority of the kata solutions are Python and use Poetry. 
- [Intellij/Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [mob](https://mob.sh) helped us to pair program effectively by doing fast code handover to each other.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (_occassional use_)
