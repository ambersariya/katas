### Scenario 1 - Add items to shopping basket

Given I add 2 units of "The Hobbit" to my shopping basket\
And I add 5 units of "Breaking Bad"\
When I check the content of my shopping basket\
Then it should contain the following information:

- Creation date (of the shopping basket)
- 2 x The Hobbit // 2 x 5.00 = £10.00
- 5 x Breaking Bad // 5 x 7.00 = £35.00
- Total: £45.00

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Shopping basket should be created when the first product is added.
- Shopping basket should be persisted (In-memory, DB later)
- Each user should have her own shopping basket.

Products available (in-memory repository):

- Books
    - 10001: Lord of the Rings - £10.00+96*54/
    - 10002: The Hobbit - £5.00
- DVDs
    - 20001: Game of Thrones - £9.00
    - 20110: Breaking Bad - £7.00

```
    public class ShoppingBasketService {

        public void addItem(UserID userId, ProductID productId, int quantity) { }

        public <?> basketFor(UserID userId) { }

    }
```

### Scenario 2 - Logging

- Log items added to shopping cart on the console:
  [ITEM ADDED TO SHOPPING CART]: User[<ID>], Product[ID], Quantity[<N>]
    ~~- Not modify original behaviour (Decorator pattern)~~

### Scenario 3 - Stock restriction

- If there are not enough items available in stock for purchase, throw exception

- When items are added to shopping basket, items should be reserved, that means,
  if there were 10 items in stock, and one user adds 8 to her shopping cart, we
  should have only 2 available for being purchase by another user.

### Scenario 4 - Multi-buy discount

- Shopping cart should contain multi-buy discount:
    - 10% discount if more than 3 books are in the cart
    - 20% discount if at least one book and video are in the cart
- In case both discounts on shopping basket apply, the biggest discount is selected.

### Scenario 5 - Payment

- Order should be created, with an OrderId.
- User submits payment, providing user and payment details
- Payment should be sent to payment gateway (external component)
- If payment is rejected, exception is thrown

```
    public class PaymentService {

        public void makePayment(UserId userId, ShoppingCartId shoppingCartId, PaymentDetails paymentDetails) { }

    }

    public class PaymentGateway {

        public PaymentReference pay(Order order, UserId userId, PaymentDetails paymentDetails)

    }
```

### Scenario 6 - Notify purchase system

- Once items are sold (payment is made) if items in stock is below threshold, notify purchase component.

```
    public class PurchaseSystem {

        public void orderMore(ProductId productId, int actualQuantity)

    }
```

### Scenario 7 - Send purchase confirmation email to user

- User should receive an email confirmation containing the order id, items bought, and price. (external)

```
    public class OrderConfirmation {

        public void send(UserId userId, OrderId orderId, PaymentReference paymentReference) { }

    }
```
