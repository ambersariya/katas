## Rules
```
1–5: The first five characters of the surname (padded with 9s if less than 5 characters)

6: The decade digit from the year of birth (e.g. for 1987 it would be 8)

7–8: The month of birth (7th character incremented by 5 if driver is female i.e. 51–62 instead of 01–12)

9–10: The date within the month of birth

11: The year digit from the year of birth (e.g. for 1987 it would be 7)

12–13: The first two initials of the first name and middle name, padded with a 9 if no middle name

14: Arbitrary digit – usually 9, but decremented to differentiate drivers with the first 13 characters in common. We will always use 9

15–16: Two computer check digits. We will always use "AA"
